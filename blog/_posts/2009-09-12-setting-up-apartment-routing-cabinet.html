I've been working on setting up a routing cabinet.  I'm not buying anything new so if I don't have something, I have to be a little creative.  Its in the kitchen, inside the wood cabinets that you usually would put dishes, pots and pans.  I had to drill a 1-1/4" hole in the bottom to run a power cable that leads to a power outlet strip, and also I can run a couple of ethernet cables through there as well.<br /><br />I do not have a layer2 switch at the moment so I had to learn again the color codes for ethernet cross over cables.  It took me 2 extra ends but it was kinda fun after I got into it.  I'll have to make more later.<br /><br />This things got a long way to go, but the router which is a breadbox linux router/wirelessAP/samba/printer/scanner server, has been running over at a friend of mines house for about 3 weeks.  They started to depend on the file server, and sometimes used it for printing.  The scanner is running local mode, and I need to test it in network mode from this Mac.<br /><br />Here's a picture, Its messy, because the cabling is not fully finished.  The can with no label is a Cantenna that should be able 12dbi range that I made a little while back.  That might be used to pick up a backup wireless :)  But the main internet uses Clearwire, which is a WiMAX protocol, city wide wifi.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5lYRT8f70Mk/SqxZ3WTDjdI/AAAAAAAAANU/knorZkqIYS0/s1600-h/DCP02388.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5lYRT8f70Mk/SqxZ3WTDjdI/AAAAAAAAANU/knorZkqIYS0/s320/DCP02388.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5380774462214082002" border="0" /></a>
