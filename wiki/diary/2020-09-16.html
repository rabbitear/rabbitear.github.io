</p>

<p>
Going thru the HTML version, I found that they are just all snippets of
code.  I'm rethinking this, and want to make it more into a <em>blog mode</em>
style.
</p>

<p>
I should <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-tell stories"></span><strong id="tell stories">tell stories</strong>, like it's to another person/user.  This will make
me want to read the wiki again, because its more fun to read stories.
Even if the information (code) gets out dated, at least I have my
thought processes.
</p>

<p>
I should not worry about the index'ing so much, but have clear unique
full stories on what I've encounted.  Again, I don't have to worry about
the order of things because, the wiki is <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-all in one directory"></span><strong id="all in one directory">all in one directory</strong> anyway.
</p>

<p>
There should be a <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-images"></span><strong id="images">images</strong> or <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-pictures"></span><strong id="pictures">pictures</strong> directory, and I might want a
script that will automaticly import <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-screen shots"></span><strong id="screen shots">screen shots</strong> into the directory,
maybe even <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-resize"></span><strong id="resize">resize</strong> them, and also add the lines of text into the wiki
or journal, as I am inside vim.
</p>

<p>
I could also do the same for <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-PDF"></span><strong id="PDF">PDF</strong> files.  A directory, then I import
those with a script.
</p>

<p>
I should also look in <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-Joplin"></span><strong id="Joplin">Joplin</strong> and get some feature ideas from it.  I
don't really use it, so maybe switch it to vimwiki.  Also I like
Joplins website ripping capiblities. <span id="A New Wiki-Some Thoughts-<span class="todo">TODO</span>"></span><strong id="<span class="todo">TODO</span>"><span class="todo">TODO</span></strong>.
</p>

<p>
So the gist is, it should be bottom up into the index.  Where I write
one article, then I figure out where it is suppose to go.  And I can use
multiple tags, if that article contains more than one topic, stuch as
it's <em>bash</em>, <em>linux</em>, and <em>networking</em>, and <em>wifi</em>.
</p>

<div id="A New Wiki-Thoughts after sleep"><h2 id="Thoughts after sleep" class="header"><a href="#A New Wiki-Thoughts after sleep">Thoughts after sleep</a></h2></div>
<p>
<span id="A New Wiki-Thoughts after sleep-vimwiki"></span><span class="tag" id="vimwiki">vimwiki</span>
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking about keeping the vimwiki format, instead of the
markdown.  There are some tools like <span id="A New Wiki-Thoughts after sleep-tagbar"></span><strong id="tagbar">tagbar</strong> that can make better use
of the vimwiki format.  I think one of the benfits of markdown is that
it handles pictures better.
</p>

<p>
If I got vimwiki, then I need to look around about how tagbar works.  It
will be easier than going to markdown.

Plugins: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
vimwiki

<li>
vimripgrep (:Rg :tags:)

<li>
\t map it to this?

</ul>


<p>
Vimwikisearchtags is slow and doesn't run quickbuffer.

Last night I compiled/installed coc.nvim successfully, with kreator's
account, and I assumed it would be a global fix, but it wasn't
appearently.  Juice has the exact same issues as we did yesterday with
coc.nvim.  This is <span id="A New Wiki-Example-why we need to wrote things down"></span><strong id="why we need to wrote things down">why we need to wrote things down</strong>!

I'm using the default vimwiki style.
I'll have 2 wiki's a tech one, that can be public
and a personal one that is private
