Learned C before high school, and attempt to keep myself out of any depression in the winter time by doing projects.  Sometimes computer related. :)<br />Below is the back of one of them, its just an itx, power supply and hard drive in a store bought bread box basket thing that a female would be looking at to decorate the bookshelf.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5lYRT8f70Mk/RzAMicnibQI/AAAAAAAAABY/oL_ljiMzA6I/s1600-h/dcp01812.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 220px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5lYRT8f70Mk/RzAMicnibQI/AAAAAAAAABY/oL_ljiMzA6I/s320/dcp01812.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5129613761512107266" border="0" /></a><br /><br />800mhz Via C3 CPU, with some ram, good light serving of anything, printers, access point, files, etc.  Its quiet, with a almost noiceless fan, unless you throw in a noisey harddrive, you don't notice its on.<br />Everybody probably has done something like this, but the box in the picture is the 3rd try.  Before the same hardware was in a hand sawed, rough cut, hacked up, wood scraps box, the screws stuck out and ruined the table, and before that a small card board box.  I can't find a picture of that wood case box, or the card board case box,  so here is a  picture of me:<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://kreator.freeshell.org/jon-pic0.png"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 484px; height: 377px;" src="http://kreator.freeshell.org/jon-pic0.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5lYRT8f70Mk/RzAUFsnibTI/AAAAAAAAABw/NMhGsGn-L-k/s1600-h/dcp01977.jpg"><br /></a>
