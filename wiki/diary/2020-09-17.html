I'm taking things out of Joplin, there's some okay stuff there, I don't
think I need to transfer everything over to vimwiki.
</p>

<p>
I'm wondering what I should put in Bug Bounty Methodology, hmmmm?!

<ul>
<li>
Here is a perfect example, I have to turn the .Wiki/tech and

</ul>
<p>
.Wiki/personal into git repo's.  Probably two?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Then I have to download my github webpage, and change it so it has a

</ul>
<p>
link to the wiki.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
I also have to find a place to store the wiki, probably inside the

</ul>
<p>
website repo, on github.
</p>

<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I'm wondering if keybase can be public?

<li>
I should write down what I did.

</ul>

<ol>
<li>
Initiallized the repo:
<pre bash>
    touch README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    keybase git create techwiki
    git remote add origin keybase://private/rabbitear/techwiki
    git push -u origin master
</pre>

</ol>
<p>
I'm thinking that it needs to be public?  But I will be the only one
pushing and pulling it, so I have the ablity to do that since keybase is
always locally stored on my machines.
