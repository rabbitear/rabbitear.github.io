# Cooler Master

My build out of older parts I had:
* Intel Xeno e3-1260l server cpu (fits in LGA 1155 socket)
* 16 gigs ddr3 RAM, clocked at 1333mhz.
* Foxconn H67S motherboard, from eBay, $50.00
* Cooler Master Elite 130 mini-itx case, from Amazon, $57.99
* EVGA 500 watt bronze plus ATX power supply
* Cooler Master ML120L RGB v2, Close-Loop AIO, from Amazon $64.99

I had a cooler master regular cpu fan, which was good, but it was loud,
around 24 dbm, according to specs.  I figure I want my ears to be able
to work when I get older, so invested in what might be quieter liquid
cooling.  Below is a photo shoot of some of the rebuild with the new
cooler.
